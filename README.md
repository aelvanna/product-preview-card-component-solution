## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this solution, I challenged myself to learn and use SCSS instead of CSS, which was a major learning outcome. I was able to continue practice using a mobile-first workflow and CSS grids.

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to continue using SCSS and improving my skills in creating responsive websites.

### Useful resources
